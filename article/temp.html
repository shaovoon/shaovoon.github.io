<p>In mid 2016, Microsoft introduced Desktop Bridge as a way to package a legacy Win32 application to be distributed in the Microsoft Store. The Win32 application running under this mode has access to UWP APIs. In this article, we are going to look at how to package the application with Desktop App Converter and MSIX Packaging Tool and certify the app with the App Certification, all of which you can download for free in the Microsoft Store. Desktop App Converter has been superceded by MSIX Packaging Tool in late 2018. The former is a commandline tool while the latter is a GUI tool. Both have their own pros and cons. As with commandline, the same command can be copied and pasted directly into command prompt and easily automated with a build script but with a GUI, options and information have to be retyped in UI every single time.</p>
